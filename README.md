# Tenhud - HUD for tenhou.net

## Installation

```
npm install -g tenhud
```

Youâ€™ll need to have Node on your machine. We recommend to use Node >= 6 and npm >= 3. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage) to get it and easily switch between versions.

## Usage
Run:

```
tenhud
```

and start regular tenhou game. I've tested it only with Flash client so far.
